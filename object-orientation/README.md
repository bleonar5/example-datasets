# README - Faces and Bodies

This project evaluate the replicability of object orientation effect across languages. The original paradigm was developed in English (Stanfield and Zwaan, 2001). The available materials were released by Zwaan and Pecher (2012).  

## Files

**STI_LIST.xls**: The sheets of all materials and stimuli lists. 
    - *STI*: Collection of all critical stimuli. `Picture_H`: File names of object pictures presented in horizontal; `Picture_V`: File names of object pictures presented in vertical; `XXX_Sentence_H`: Sentences implied the horizontal orientation of the target object; `XXX_Sentence_V`: Sentences implied the vertical orientation of the target object. XXX stands for the which language the sentences written in.
    - *Fillers*: Collection of all filler stimuli. `Picture_Fillers_A` and `Picture_Fillers_B`: File names of object pictures which are irrelavent to the corresponding sentences; `XXX_Sentence_Fillers_A` and `XXX_Sentence_Fillers_B`: Sentences which do not imply the particular orientation of object; XXX stands for the which language the sentences written in.
    - *Prac1* and *Prac2*: Stimuli list of practice trials. 
    - *XXX_LIST1*, *XXX_LIST2*, *XXX_LIST3*, and *XXX_LIST4*: Stimuli lists of experimental trials for sentence-picture verification. XXX stands for the which language the sentences written in.
    - *PP_LIST1*, *PP_LIST2*, *PP_LIST3*, and *PP_LIST4*: Stimuli lists of experimental trials for picture-picture verification. 
    
**LAB_processing.R**: R script which merge raw data and filter the variables to be analyzed. There will be three csv files created in the folder `raw_data`: `ID_SP_V.csv`,`ID_SP_M.csv`, and `ID_PP.csv`. `ID` stands for the specific ID for the study site. This script is for the processing of the data from one study site.

**OrientationCrossLanguages_2018PSA_SP_1.2.0.osexp**: Opensesame script of sentence-picture verification task for one study site. The instructions and materials will be translated to the site langauge before the beginning.

**OrientationCrossLanguages_2018PSA_PP_1.2.0.osexp**: Opensesame script of picture-picture verification task for one study site. The instructions and materials will be translated to the site langauge before the beginning.
