# README - Template project

This is a README file. It is a [Markdown file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which means it's a simple text document, but you can use simple syntax like you see here and many programs will display it more nicely - for instance, the words 'Markdown file' will appear as a link that goes to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown`.

This is the first document someone will read when they access your project! Write something informative in here, such as:

* A quick summary of what the project is

* A list of what files can be found in this folder and what they are

* Instructions for how to cite this dataset/project. You can also put your citation information in `dataset_description.JSON`!
